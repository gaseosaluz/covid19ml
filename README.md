# Detecting COVID-19 in X-Ray Images
This notebook is a re-implemenation of the Python code found in "Detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning" (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/03/16/detecting-covid-19-in-x-ray-images-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/).

For the most part this Notebook takes the same algorithmic steps as the original article where (if) I make changes I note this.

I have split the code in various 'blocks' so that I can combine the comments fromt the original post with some of the embedded comments in the code itself. I did this becasue this gave me more clarity on what Adrian's code is doing. Also in many cases, I have separated Adrian's original code (as shown in his blog) post into seprate blocks, again accompanied by his comments or some personal minor observations.
